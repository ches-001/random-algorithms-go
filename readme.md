# Random Algorithms Go...

A repository for random algorithms implemented in C++, for now this repository will most be focused on metaheuristic search algorithms like TSP (Traveling Sales Person with genetic algorithm, solving Santa polytype puzzles with A-star, IDA-star, beam search, etc), because why not? For more info on these Santa polytype puzzles, see [this](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2023).

PS: There are no comments nor documentation for the contents of this repo yet, you'll have to just figure it out, reach out to me to clarify somethings you wish to ask, and also suggest possible improvements for the algorithms that will be making its way to this place.
Also, the heuristic function used for the combinatorics puzzles is not admissible (yet), it does not take orientation into account, hence
the reason it will struggle with a lot of the complex puzzles, especially beam search that struggles with basically all puzzles except the first cube2x2 puzzle. A-star with the current heuristics is capable of solving all cube2x2, all wreath6/6, wreath7/7 and some wreath12/12, likewise IDA-star (but slower). Eventually, I plan to develop a more robust heuristics finding technique (I'm leaning towards using an ML approach that does Autodidactic Iteration Learning) for this.
