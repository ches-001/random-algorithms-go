# Random Algorithms Go...

A repository for random algorithms implemented in C++, for now this repository will most be focused on metaheuristic search algorithms like TSP (Traveling Sales Person with genetic algorithm, solving Santa polytype puzzles with A-star, IDA-star, beam search, etc), because why not? For more info on these Santa polytype puzzles, see [this](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2023).

PS: There are no comments nor documentation for the contents of this repo yet, you'll have to just figure it out, reach out to me to clarify somethings you wish to ask, and also suggest possible improvements for the algorithms that will be making its way to this place.
